    <h2>Real World Consequences</h2>
    <!-- Page introduction -->
    <p>Surveillance capitalism isn't theoretical — it has already caused real harm to real people. Here are documented cases where data extraction led to manipulation, discrimination, and abuse.</p>

    <!-- Warning banner explaining the severity -->
    <div class="warning-banner">
      <p>⚠️ <strong>Content Warning:</strong> The following cases involve discrimination, manipulation, and harm. They are included to demonstrate the real-world impact of surveillance capitalism.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Case Study 1: Cambridge Analytica -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">CASE STUDY</span>
      <h3>Cambridge Analytica: Election Manipulation</h3>
      <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica obtained behavioral data on millions of Facebook users (without their consent) and used it to create psychological profiles.</p>
      <p><strong>The Data:</strong> They combined Facebook behavioral data with consumer data, financial information, and social media activity to build detailed psychological profiles on voters.</p>
      <p><strong>The Manipulation:</strong> Armed with this data, they created thousands of customized political advertisements targeting specific psychological vulnerabilities. One voter might see messages about immigration, another about healthcare — all designed to manipulate their emotions and voting behavior.</p>
      <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Used in the 2016 US Presidential election, Brexit campaign, and numerous other elections worldwide. Demonstrated that elections could be influenced through targeted data manipulation.</p>
      <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Your behavioral data is powerful enough to swing elections. When combined with psychological profiling, it becomes a tool for mass manipulation.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Case Study 2: Clearview AI -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">CASE STUDY</span>
      <h3>Clearview AI: Mass Facial Recognition Database</h3>
      <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Clearview AI scraped billions of photos from social media, dating apps, and other websites to build a facial recognition database without consent.</p>
      <p><strong>The Data:</strong> Over 30 billion photos from Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, dating apps, and mugshot databases combined into one massive facial recognition system.</p>
      <p><strong>The Access:</strong> Sold access to law enforcement, immigration agencies, and private companies. Police could upload a photo of anyone and instantly find all their social media profiles and other information.</p>
      <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Innocent people were arrested based on faulty facial recognition matches. Protesters were tracked and identified. Immigration enforcement used it to target undocumented immigrants and their families.</p>
      <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Your photos are being used to build surveillance systems you didn't consent to. Facial recognition combined with behavioral data creates unprecedented tracking capabilities.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Case Study 3: Amazon Ring -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">CASE STUDY</span>
      <h3>Amazon Ring: Neighborhood Surveillance Network</h3>
      <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Amazon's Ring doorbell cameras are creating a crowdsourced surveillance network. Police departments can request footage from neighbors' cameras, and homeowners unknowingly participate in tracking people.</p>
      <p><strong>The Data:</strong> Real-time video of everyone entering/leaving homes, faces, vehicles, license plates, and movement patterns throughout neighborhoods.</p>
      <p><strong>The Surveillance:</strong> Police access footage without warrants. Amazon shares data with law enforcement. Innocent people are recorded and tracked in their own neighborhoods.</p>
      <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Reduced privacy in public spaces. Racial profiling amplified through automated surveillance. Protesters and activists tracked. Abusive partners using Ring data to monitor ex-partners.</p>
      <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Surveillance capitalism extends beyond the internet. Physical world tracking combines with digital data to create inescapable surveillance.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Case Study 4: Target Pregnancy Prediction -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">CASE STUDY</span>
      <h3>Target: Predicting Pregnancy Before You Tell Anyone</h3>
      <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Target used behavioral surplus to predict which customers were pregnant based on purchasing patterns.</p>
      <p><strong>The Data:</strong> Purchases of unscented lotion, vitamin supplements, cotton balls, and other products were analyzed to identify pregnant women.</p>
      <p><strong>The Targeting:</strong> Pregnant women received targeted promotions for baby products before they'd told friends, family, or sometimes even their partners.</p>
      <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> One father discovered his teenage daughter was pregnant through a Target ad sent to his home. People's most private moments were monetized without their knowledge.</p>
      <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Companies know intimate details about your life from behavioral surplus. This data is used to target you at vulnerable moments.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Discrimination Cases -->
    <h3 class="section-title">Algorithmic Discrimination</h3>

    <!-- Discrimination Case 1: Criminal Justice -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">CASE STUDY</span>
      <h3>COMPAS: Racist Sentencing Algorithm</h3>
      <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Courts used the COMPAS algorithm to predict recidivism risk and inform sentencing decisions.</p>
      <p><strong>The Bias:</strong> The algorithm was trained on historical criminal justice data that reflects systemic racism. It learned to associate race with criminal risk.</p>
      <p><strong>The Results:</strong> Black defendants were labeled "high risk" at twice the rate of white defendants. They received longer sentences based on algorithmic predictions trained on racist historical data.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Innocent people received harsher sentences. Systemic racism was mathematized and made to seem objective.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Discrimination Case 2: Hiring -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">CASE STUDY</span>
      <h3>Amazon's Biased Hiring Algorithm</h3>
      <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Amazon developed an AI recruiting tool that was supposed to help screen job candidates faster.</p>
      <p><strong>The Bias:</strong> Trained on 10 years of historical hiring data from a male-dominated tech industry, the algorithm learned to discriminate against women.</p>
      <p><strong>The Results:</strong> Women's resumes were downranked. Female candidates were filtered out before humans even saw them. The algorithm had learned that men were "better" candidates because that's who had been hired historically.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Systemic discrimination against women in hiring, made invisible by "objective" algorithms.</p>

    <!-- Mental Health Impact Card -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      <div class="impact-icon">😰</div>
      <h3>Anxiety and Depression in Youth</h3>
      <p>Teen suicide rates, anxiety, and depression have spiked in correlation with social media adoption. Algorithms optimize for engagement by showing content that triggers emotional reactions — anger, fear, and anxiety are highly engaging.</p>
      <p>Your behavioral data shows what upsets you, what triggers anxiety, and what keeps you scrolling. Algorithms use this to maximize your time on platform, knowing it's harming your mental health.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Misinformation Impact Card -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      <div class="impact-icon">🤥</div>
      <h3>Misinformation and Filter Bubbles</h3>
      <p>Algorithmic feeds personalized on behavioral data create "filter bubbles" — you only see content that confirms your existing beliefs. Misinformation spreads faster than truth because emotional (false) content is more engaging.</p>
      <p>Your behavioral surplus determines what reality you see. Different people live in different information universes, making shared truth impossible.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Addiction Impact Card -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      <div class="impact-icon">📱</div>
      <h3>Behavioral Addiction</h3>
      <p>Tech platforms are deliberately designed to be addictive. Former Facebook and Google engineers have admitted to engineering addiction features.</p>
      <p>Notifications, infinite scroll, and algorithmic feeds are all designed using behavioral surplus insights to maximize screen time and create dependency.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Economic Harm -->
    <h3 class="section-title">Economic Harm</h3>

    <!-- Predatory Lending Case -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">CASE STUDY</span>
      <h3>Predatory Lending: Data-Driven Exploitation</h3>
      <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Payday lending companies use behavioral data to identify vulnerable people in financial distress.</p>
      <p><strong>The Data:</strong> They track people who search for "quick loans," have late bill payments, and show other signs of financial distress.</p>
      <p><strong>The Targeting:</strong> Aggressive ads targeted at desperate people offering loans with 400%+ APR interest rates.</p>
      <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Low-income individuals trapped in debt cycles. Behavioral surplus is used to identify and exploit the most vulnerable people.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Discriminatory Pricing -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">CASE STUDY</span>
      <h3>Dynamic Pricing: You Pay More Based on Your Data</h3>
      <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Online retailers use behavioral data to show different prices to different people for the same product.</p>
      <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> If your data shows you have high income, you see a higher price. If your browsing history shows you're desperate to buy, the price goes up. If you're on mobile (suggesting you're on-the-go and less price-sensitive), you pay more.</p>
      <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Same product, different prices. Those with less money pay more because companies know they're less price-sensitive or less likely to comparison shop.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Privacy warning: Summary of Harms -->
    <div class="privacy-warning">
      <h3>The Common Thread</h3>
      <p>These cases share a pattern: <strong>Behavioral surplus is used to target the most vulnerable, manipulate people at scale, and amplify existing inequalities.</strong></p>
      <p>Your data is weaponized against you. The more data companies have, the better they can exploit you.</p>
