    <h2>What Is Surveillance Capitalism?</h2>
    
    <!-- Introduction paragraph -->
    <p>Coined by Shoshana Zuboff, surveillance capitalism describes an economic system that claims human experience as free raw material for extraction, prediction, and profit.</p>
    
    <!-- Explanation of how tech companies operate -->
    <p>Companies like Google and Meta collect massive amounts of behavioral data from users. These data are processed through machine learning systems to predict and influence future behavior — the foundation of a trillion-dollar digital economy.</p>
    
    <!-- Definition of the core concept -->
    <p>Unlike traditional capitalism, where goods are exchanged for money, here our private moments become the raw material for a new kind of market: the trade in human futures.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Key Characteristics</h3>

    <!-- Individual characteristic card 1: Data extraction -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      
      <h3>Data Extraction</h3>
      <p>Every interaction online is recorded and stored. Your searches, clicks, locations, contacts, and even your thoughts (typed but not sent) are all collected and monetized.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Individual characteristic card 2: Behavioral prediction -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      
      <h3>Behavioral Prediction</h3>
      <p>Machine learning algorithms analyze your data to predict what you will do next. These predictions are then sold to advertisers and used to influence your behavior.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Individual characteristic card 3: Behavioral modification -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      
      <h3>Behavioral Modification</h3>
      <p>Once companies can predict your behavior, they can influence it. Through targeted ads, personalized feeds, and algorithmic recommendations, they shape what you see, think, and do.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Quote from a key thinker on the subject -->
    <div class="quote-box">
      <p>"Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims experience as raw material for behavioral predictions. As the surplus of behavioral data has grown and as the economic value of predictions has become clear, we are now facing unprecedented circumstances in the history of capitalism." — Shoshana Zuboff</p>
