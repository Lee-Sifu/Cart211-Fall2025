    <h2>Ethical & Legal Issues</h2>
    <!-- Page introduction -->
    <p>Surveillance capitalism operates in a legal gray area. While much of it is technically legal, it raises serious ethical questions and is increasingly being regulated. Here's where the law and ethics intersect.</p>

    <!-- Section: The Problem With "Consent" -->
    <h3 class="section-title">The Illusion of Consent</h3>

    <!-- Interactive consent demo -->
    <div class="consent-demo">

    <!-- Explanation of the consent problem -->
    <div class="privacy-warning">
      <h3>Why "Consent" Is a Myth</h3>
      <p>Companies claim users "consent" to surveillance by accepting terms of service. But this consent is:</p>
      <ul style="margin-top: 15px; margin-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Forced:</strong> You can't access essential services without accepting surveillance</li>
        <li><strong>Uninformed:</strong> Terms are intentionally long and incomprehensible</li>
        <li><strong>Unequal:</strong> One-sided agreements give all power to companies</li>
        <li><strong>Impossible to refuse:</strong> Every major platform uses identical surveillance models</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Current Laws -->
    <h3 class="section-title">What Laws Exist Today?</h3>

    <!-- GDPR card -->
    <div class="tool-box">
      <div class="tool-icon">🇪🇺</div>
      <h4>GDPR (Europe)</h4>
      <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2018</p>
      <p><strong>Scope:</strong> Applies to all data collection in the EU and by EU-based companies</p>
      <p><strong>Key Requirements:</strong></p>
      <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
        <li>Companies must get explicit consent before collecting data</li>
        <li>Users have right to access their data</li>
        <li>Users have right to delete their data (Right to be Forgotten)</li>
        <li>Companies must report data breaches within 72 hours</li>
        <li>Huge fines for violations (up to 4% of global revenue)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Better than nothing, but companies have found loopholes</p>
    </div>

    <!-- CCPA card -->
    <div class="tool-box">
      <div class="tool-icon">🇺🇸</div>
      <h4>CCPA (California, USA)</h4>
      <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2020</p>
      <p><strong>Scope:</strong> Applies to companies collecting data on California residents</p>
      <p><strong>Key Requirements:</strong></p>
      <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
        <li>Companies must disclose what data they collect</li>
        <li>Users can request deletion of their data</li>
        <li>Users can opt-out of data sales</li>
        <li>Fines for violations</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Weaker than GDPR, companies still collect "for business purposes"</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Other laws -->
    <div class="tool-box">
      <h4>Other Privacy Laws</h4>
      <p><strong>Canada (PIPEDA):</strong> Requires consent and transparency</p>
      <p><strong>Brazil (LGPD):</strong> Similar to GDPR with 11 purposes for data collection</p>
      <p><strong>UK (UK GDPR):</strong> Post-Brexit version of European privacy law</p>
      <p><strong>China (PIPL):</strong> Strong privacy law, but enforced selectively</p>
      <p><strong>USA:</strong> Patchwork of sector-specific laws (health, financial) but no comprehensive federal privacy law</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Why Laws Are Inadequate -->
    <h3 class="section-title">Why Existing Laws Fall Short</h3>

    <!-- Loophole 1: Consent -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">LOOPHOLE</span>
      <h3>The Consent Trap</h3>
      <p>Companies fulfill legal requirements by getting "consent" — but the consent is essentially forced. Users must accept surveillance or be excluded from essential services.</p>
      <p>True consent requires choice. When all platforms use identical surveillance models, there's no meaningful choice.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Loophole 2: Anonymization -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">LOOPHOLE</span>
      <h3>Pseudo-Anonymization Loophole</h3>
      <p>Companies claim data is "anonymized" so it's not covered by privacy laws. But researchers have shown that "anonymized" data can be re-identified when combined with other datasets.</p>
      <p>Meta, Netflix, and others have had supposedly anonymous data re-identified multiple times, proving anonymization is insufficient.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Loophole 3: Third Parties -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">LOOPHOLE</span>
      <h3>Third-Party Exception</h3>
      <p>Companies claim they're not responsible for trackers and data brokers they partner with. When you visit a website, third-party trackers aren't regulated by the same laws.</p>
      <p>You never consented to those trackers directly, but the distinction doesn't protect your privacy.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Loophole 4: Bulk Sales -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">LOOPHOLE</span>
      <h3>Data Broker Sales Loophole</h3>
      <p>Data brokers in the US operate with almost no regulation. They buy and sell billions of data points with no oversight or transparency.</p>
      <p>The FTC has limited power to regulate them, and enforcement is rare.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Ethical Arguments -->
    <h3 class="section-title">Ethical Arguments Against Surveillance Capitalism</h3>

    <!-- Autonomy argument -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      <h3>The Autonomy Argument</h3>
      <p>Autonomy — the right to act freely according to your own choices — is a fundamental human right. Surveillance capitalism destroys autonomy by:</p>
      <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Making your private choices observable to others</li>
        <li>Using data to manipulate your future choices</li>
        <li>Creating power imbalances where corporations know you better than you know yourself</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if you "consent," that consent doesn't override your fundamental right to autonomy.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Dignity argument -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      <h3>The Dignity Argument</h3>
      <p>Human dignity requires that we not be treated as objects to be studied, manipulated, and exploited. Surveillance capitalism treats human experience as a commodity — a violation of human dignity.</p>
      <p>Your thoughts, relationships, and private moments have intrinsic value beyond their market value.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Democracy argument -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      <h3>The Democracy Argument</h3>
      <p>Democracy requires informed citizens making free choices. Surveillance capitalism:</p>
      <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Enables mass manipulation at scale</li>
        <li>Creates information bubbles where people see different realities</li>
        <li>Gives unelected corporations power over public opinion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These undermine the foundations of democratic governance.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Fairness argument -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      <h3>The Fairness Argument</h3>
      <p>You create value through your behavioral data, but you're not compensated. Meanwhile, companies extract billions in profit.</p>
      <p>Basic fairness suggests you should either:</p>
      <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Not have your data extracted without compensation, or</li>
        <li>Be paid a fair share of the profit from your data</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: The Path Forward -->
    <h3 class="section-title">What Stronger Laws Would Look Like</h3>

    <!-- Future law 1 -->
    <div class="resource-card">
      <div class="resource-header">
        <span class="resource-title">Ban Behavioral Surplus</span>
      </div>
      <p>Require companies to only collect data necessary for the stated service. No more "behavioral surplus" extraction beyond what's needed to serve you better.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Future law 2 -->
    <div class="resource-card">
      <div class="resource-header">
        <span class="resource-title">Data Minimization</span>
      </div>
      <p>Require companies to delete data when it's no longer needed for the stated purpose. Data retention should have strict time limits.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Future law 3 -->
    <div class="resource-card">
      <div class="resource-header">
        <span class="resource-title">Algorithmic Transparency</span>
      </div>
      <p>Require algorithms to be audited for bias. Users should understand why they're seeing what they're seeing.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Future law 4 -->
    <div class="resource-card">
      <div class="resource-header">
        <span class="resource-title">Regulation of Data Brokers</span>
      </div>
      <p>Data brokers should be regulated like financial institutions. Clear rules about what data can be sold and to whom.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Future law 5 -->
    <div class="resource-card">
      <div class="resource-header">
        <span class="resource-title">Right to Refuse Surveillance</span>
      </div>
      <p>You should be able to access essential services without consenting to surveillance. Alternative, non-surveillance options should be available.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h3 class="section-title">The Bottom Line</h3>
    <div class="quote-highlight">
      <p>Surveillance capitalism is legal not because it's ethical, but because companies shaped the laws. Change requires political will — which requires informed citizens demanding better.</p>
      <p>You have the power to demand change. Use it.</p>
