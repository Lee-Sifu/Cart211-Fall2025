    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <!-- Page introduction -->
    <p>Surveillance capitalism isn't just about annoying ads. It fundamentally reshapes power, democracy, autonomy, and human freedom. Here's why you should care.</p>

    <!-- Section: Loss of privacy and autonomy -->
    <h3 class="section-title">1. Loss of Privacy and Autonomy</h3>
    <!-- Impact card explaining privacy loss -->
    <div class="impact-card">
     
      <h3>Your Private Life Is No Longer Private</h3>
      <p>There's no escape. Your home, your relationships, your secret thoughts typed but never sent — all collected. Autonomy requires the ability to act freely without surveillance. When you're always watched, you're never truly free.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Democratic manipulation -->
    <h3 class="section-title">2. Threat to Democracy</h3>
    <!-- Impact card explaining democratic threat -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      
      <h3>Elections Are Decided in the Shadows</h3>
      <p>Political campaigns use behavioral surplus to micro-target voters with personalized messages. Each voter sees a different reality, making rational collective decision-making impossible. Democracy requires shared facts; surveillance capitalism destroys that.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Psychological manipulation -->
    <h3 class="section-title">3. Psychological Manipulation</h3>
    <!-- Impact card explaining psychological effects -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      
      <h3>Your Mind Is Being Hacked</h3>
      <p>Algorithms know which content will trigger you emotionally. Notification systems are designed like slot machines to create addiction. Your attention is the product being sold, and companies employ thousands of engineers to make you spend more time looking at screens.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Interactive demonstration section -->
    <h3 class="section-title">Interactive: How Manipulation Works</h3>
    <!-- Demonstration of behavioral manipulation techniques -->
    <div class="manipulation-demo">
      <h4>What if an algorithm knew your vulnerabilities?</h4>
      <!-- Step-by-step flow showing manipulation -->
      <div class="manipulation-flow">
        <div class="manipulation-step" style="--delay: 0;">
        
          <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Algorithm watches you</p>
        </div>

          <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Learns your psychology</p>

          <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Triggers the response</p>
        </div>

    <!-- Section: Economic inequality -->
    <h3 class="section-title">4. Widening Economic Inequality</h3>
    <!-- Impact card explaining economic effects -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      
      <h3>The Rich Escape, the Poor Pay More</h3>
      <p>Those with resources can buy privacy. The wealthy use premium services, VPNs, and data brokers to protect themselves. Meanwhile, low-income individuals are tracked most intensively and face discriminatory pricing and predatory targeting.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Corporate power -->
    <h3 class="section-title">5. Unchecked Corporate Power</h3>
    <!-- Impact card explaining corporate dominance -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      
      <h3>Tech Giants Know More Than Governments</h3>
      <p>Google, Meta, and Amazon have more detailed information about you than your government. They use this power to influence policy, avoid regulation, and maintain their monopolies. This creates a new form of corporate authoritarianism.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Discrimination and bias -->
    <h3 class="section-title">6. Algorithmic Discrimination</h3>
    <!-- Impact card explaining discrimination -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      
      <h3>Algorithms Amplify Bias</h3>
      <p>Machine learning models trained on biased historical data perpetuate and amplify discrimination. Your credit score, insurance rates, job opportunities, and even criminal sentencing can be determined by algorithms trained on racist, sexist data.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Privacy warning section -->
    <div class="privacy-warning">
      <h3>The Paradox of Choice</h3>
      <p>You can't simply "opt out" of surveillance capitalism. These systems are so pervasive that participating is essentially mandatory in modern life. The appearance of choice ("You can always use a different social platform") masks the reality that all platforms use identical surveillance models.</p>
