For this final website project, I went with a different approach compared to my peers. My website was more of a informative site and 

providing tips and alternatives to what people could do. As well as provind links to books that explains these issues like Zuboff's 

Surveillance Capitalism pdf version. 

There were some interactive features I added just to show users an idea. 

I went with a simple aethetics with the main colors being black, cyan and white as well as other secondary colors. For the html and css 

files, I used all the lessons and resources I learned as well as some previous knowledge before taking Cart 211. With a bit of 

javascript for that 

interactive functionality.
