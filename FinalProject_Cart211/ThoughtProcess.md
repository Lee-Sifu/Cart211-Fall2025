For this final website project, I went with a different approach compared to my peers. My website was more of a informative site and 

providing tips and alternatives to what people could do. There were some interactive features I added just to show users an idea. 

I went with a simple aethetics with the main colors being black, cyan and white as well as other secondary colors. For the html and css 

files, I used all the lessons I was taught as well as some previous knowledge before taking Cart 211. With a bit of javascript for that 

interactive functionality.
