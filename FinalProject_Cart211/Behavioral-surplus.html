    <h2>Behavioral Surplus Explained</h2>
    <p>Behavioral surplus refers to the extra data that companies collect beyond what is necessary to improve a service. Google discovered that this surplus could be used to predict and shape user behavior — forming the backbone of surveillance capitalism.</p>
    <p>Every keystroke, location ping, or voice command becomes part of a hidden feedback loop: collected, analyzed, and sold to advertisers eager to anticipate your next move. The more you interact online, the richer the data supply becomes.</p>
    <p>Understanding behavioral surplus helps reveal the imbalance of power between users and platforms — a one-way mirror where your life is the content, and the market is always watching.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #66fcf1; margin-top: 40px;">Real Examples of Behavioral Surplus</h3>

    <div class="example-toggle">
      <strong>Example 1: Gmail Scanning</strong>
      <span class="warning-badge">SOLD TO ADVERTISERS</span>
    </div>
    <div class="example-content">
      <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Google scanned the content of your emails to build a profile of your interests, relationships, and upcoming plans.</p>
      <p><strong>The surplus:</strong> They didn't just deliver your email — they analyzed every word, contact, and attachment to predict your future behavior and sell targeted ads.</p>
      <p><strong>Your data = their profit:</strong> Mention a vacation? Get travel ads. Mention a wedding? Get ads for venues, dresses, and rings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-toggle">
      <strong>Example 2: Smart Thermostat Learning</strong>
      <span class="warning-badge">PATTERN PREDICTION</span>
    </div>
    <div class="example-content">
      <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Your Nest thermostat learns when you're home and adjusts temperature accordingly — convenient!</p>
      <p><strong>The surplus:</strong> It also tracks when you wake up, when you leave for work, when you come home, when you sleep, and when you're on vacation.</p>
      <p><strong>Who buys this?:</strong> Insurance companies want to know your routines. Advertisers want to know when to send you notifications. This data has been sold to utility companies and third-party data brokers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-toggle">
      <strong>Example 3: Facebook "Likes"</strong>
      <span class="warning-badge">PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILING</span>
    </div>
    <div class="example-content">
      <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Cambridge Analytica used Facebook likes to build psychological profiles of 87 million users.</p>
      <p><strong>The surplus:</strong> Your likes on cat photos, political posts, and brands revealed your personality traits, political leanings, intelligence level, and likelihood to be influenced.</p>
      <p><strong>The impact:</strong> These profiles were used for political micro-targeting in the 2016 US election and Brexit referendum.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-toggle">
      <strong>Example 4: Fitness Tracker Routes</strong>
      <span class="warning-badge">SECURITY RISK</span>
    </div>
    <div class="example-content">
      <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Strava's heat map feature revealed the locations and patrol routes of military bases in conflict zones.</p>
      <p><strong>The surplus:</strong> Your jogging route, time, speed, and heart rate are all captured. When aggregated, this revealed secret military installations because soldiers were using fitness trackers.</p>
      <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Your "personal" fitness data can expose sensitive locations and patterns you never intended to share.</p>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top: 40px;">Understanding behavioral surplus helps reveal the imbalance of power between users and platforms — a one-way mirror where your life is the content, and the market is always watching.</p>
