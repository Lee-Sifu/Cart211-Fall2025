    <h2>Behavioral Surplus Explained</h2>
    
    <!-- Definition and introduction -->
    <p>Behavioral surplus refers to the extra data that companies collect beyond what is necessary to improve a service. Google discovered that this surplus could be used to predict and shape user behavior — forming the backbone of surveillance capitalism.</p>
    
    <!-- Explanation of data collection -->
    <p>Every keystroke, location ping, or voice command becomes part of a hidden feedback loop: collected, analyzed, and sold to advertisers eager to anticipate your next move. The more you interact online, the richer the data supply becomes.</p>
    
    <!-- Core concept explanation -->
    <p>Understanding behavioral surplus helps reveal the imbalance of power between users and platforms — a one-way mirror where your life is the content, and the market is always watching.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">How Companies Use Behavioral Surplus</h3>

    <!-- Use case 1: Prediction -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      
      <h3>Prediction Markets</h3>
      <p>Your behavioral surplus becomes a "future" — a prediction that you will buy Product X, click on Ad Y, or vote for Candidate Z. These predictions are traded like commodities in markets that are invisible to you.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Use case 2: Manipulation -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      
      <h3>Behavioral Modification</h3>
      <p>Once companies know what you will do, they use surplus data to nudge you toward profitable behaviors. Your feed is algorithmically curated to keep you scrolling longer.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Use case 3: Discrimination -->
    <div class="impact-card">
      
      <h3>Discriminatory Pricing</h3>
      <p>Surplus data is used to determine how much to charge you for products, what prices you'll see, and whether you're even shown certain opportunities. The more valuable you are as a target, the higher your price.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Real-world example -->
    <h3 class="section-title">A Real-World Example</h3>

    <!-- Case study card -->
    <div class="case-study">
      <span class="case-label">CASE STUDY</span>
      <h3>Target Predicts Pregnancy</h3>
      <p>Target's algorithm discovered it could identify pregnant women by tracking their purchases (prenatal vitamins, unscented lotion, large quantities of cotton balls).</p>
      <p>They sent targeted ads to these women before they even told friends or family they were pregnant. This surplus data about your shopping patterns revealed something deeply personal that you intended to keep private.</p>
      <p><strong>This is behavioral surplus at work:</strong> Target didn't need this prediction to serve you better. They collected it because it was valuable to sell to other companies (baby product makers, advertisers, insurance companies).</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="section-title">The Hidden Economy of Surplus</h3>

    <!-- Statistical highlight -->
    <div class="profit-stat">
      $227 Billion
      <span class="stat-label">Annual digital ad market size (largely driven by behavioral surplus)</span>
    </div>

    <!-- Explanation of the market -->
    <p>Your behavioral surplus has real financial value. When you don't see prices or ad costs, it's because that market is hidden from you. Companies are buying and selling predictions about your future behavior in markets you don't know exist.</p>

    <!-- Privacy warning -->
    <div class="privacy-warning">
      <h3>The Key Insight</h3>
      <p>Behavioral surplus exists in the gap between what companies need to serve you and what they actually collect. <strong>That gap is profit.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: How to protect yourself -->
    <h3 class="section-title">How to Protect Your Surplus</h3>

    <!-- Tool recommendation 1 -->
    <div class="tool-box">
     
      <h4>Use Ad Blockers</h4>
      <p>Block third-party trackers and ad networks from collecting your surplus data. Extensions like uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger are free.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Tool recommendation 2 -->
    <div class="tool-box">
      
      <h4>Use a VPN</h4>
      <p>Hide your IP address and location from trackers. Make it harder for companies to build a complete profile of your behavior.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Tool recommendation 3 -->
    <div class="tool-box">
      
      <h4>Disable Location Services</h4>
      <p>Turn off GPS location tracking on your phone. Limit location access to only apps that truly need it.</p>
